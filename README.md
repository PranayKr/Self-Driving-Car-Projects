# Implementation of an Advanced Lane-Detection-Algorithm by applying concepts of Camera Calibration , Distortion Correction , Color Transform , Gradient Threshold , Perspective Transform , Histogram Peak and Sliding Windows methods for Lane Detection , Radius of Curvature and Relative Vehicle Postion Calculations

# Problem Statement Description
For this project the task is to accurately identify lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera fixed on top of a car by coding
a Image Analysis Pipeline using multiple image processing concepts and algorithms
