# Implementation of Car-Driving Behavior Cloning using Unity Self-Driving Car Simulator and Convolutional Neural Network Model with Keras Library to execute Supervised Learning with Logistic Regression Algorithm to predict correct steering angle to be taken by the simulated car based on the inputs of LIVE Feed of Center , Left and Right Cameras mounted on top of the Car 

# Problem Statement Description
For this project the task is to accurately predict the steering angle to be taken by the simulated car based on the inputs of LIVE Camera Feed of Center , Left and Right Cameras mounted on top of the Car and hence clone / imitate the driving behaviour of a real person behind the steering wheel.

# Installation Instructions to setup the Project :
### Setting Up Python Environment :
  a) Download and install Anaconda 3 (latest version 5.3) from this link (https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
    for the specific Operating System and Architecure (64-bit or 32-bit) being used
    for Python 3.6 + version onwards
    
  b) Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.:
    Open Anaconda prompt and then execute the below given commands
    
    Linux or Mac:
    conda create --name sdcnd python=3.6
    source activate sdcnd
    
    Windows:
    conda create --name sdcnd python=3.6 
    activate sdcnd
    
  c) Clone the below provided Self-Driving Car Simulator Repository
     (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim.git)
     
  d) Install Unity and then load the self-drive-car-sim project in Unity IDE  
    
  e) Then, install the dependencies (numpy/matplotlib/opencv/keras/argparse and other libraries) by executing the below commands in 
     Anaconda Prompt Shell :
     
     Windows:
     1) conda install numpy
     2) conda install pandas
     3) conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib     
     4) conda install -c conda-forge opencv
     5) conda install -c conda-forge keras
     5) Install other libraries as required using conda package manager

# Details of Training the model
  1) Start up the Udacity self-driving simulator, choose a scene and press the Training Mode button.
  2) Select a folder in which all the training images generated during manual run would be saved
  3) Maneuver the Simulated Car in the Unity Environment in either Lake Road environment or Jungle Track environment
     to generate training images
  4) After the training images have been generated run either of the following commands in Ananconda Prompt Shell
     Option 1 :  python model.py (Version 1) 
     Option 2 :  python model_V2.py (Version 2)
     
     After Training is over a file "model.h5" would be generated for Version 1 or a file "model_updated.h5" would be generated for
     Version 2

# Details of running the Code Implementation :
  1) First of all clone this repository (https://github.com/PranayKr/Self-Driving-Car-Projects.git) on local system.
  2) Open Anaconda prompt shell window and navigate inside the Behavior-Cloning/ cloned repository folder.
  3) Start up the Udacity self-driving simulator, choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.
  3) Run the pretrained model by executing the following command : 
     Option 1 :  python drive.py model.h5 (Version 1) 
     Option 2 :  python drive_V2.py model_updated.h5 (Version 2)
